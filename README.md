# Music-Learning-System-with-Hand-Tracking

## Objective and Vision
This project aims at creating a human-computer interface application that helps bring alive the experience of learning music in a way like never before. Learning in classrooms often brings along with it a certain amount of boredom unless there is some application that can make things exciting and rejuvenate young minds. To make this more interesting, exciting new technology with the right guided approach can make learning not only more effective but also spike a general inclination towards asking questions, and critical thinking and creativity. The idea of this project is to enable young primary school kids to learn more about different instruments through an interactive web app and make it more interesting using hand tracking so they can learn about any instrument of their choice, from a set of options, learn more about it and also have the opportunity to play that instrument simply with their hand gestures, not requiring dexterity of any kind at their tender age to enjoy the experience.
