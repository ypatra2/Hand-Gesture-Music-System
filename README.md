# Music-Learning-System-with-Hand-Tracking
The idea of this project is to enable young primary school kids to learn more about different instruments through an interactive web app and make it more interesting using hand tracking so they can learn about any instrument of their choice, from a set of options, learn more about it and play that instrument simply with their hand gestures
