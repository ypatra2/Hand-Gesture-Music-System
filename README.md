# Hand Gesture Music System
This project implements a real-time hand gesture recognition system using MediaPipe. It allows users to play music using SCAMP (Suite for Computer-Assisted Music in Python) by selecting an instrument of their choice through hand movements captured by a webcam. The instrument selection is realized through a Web App built using Streamlit in Python. This is a Human Computer Interaction (HCI) Application Project.

## Features
<li><strong>Hand Gesture Recognition: </strong>Utilizes Mediapipe for real-time hand gesture detection and classification for detecting which note is played by training a deep learning image model on (Teachable Machine by Google) with image samples <href>https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/</href></li>
